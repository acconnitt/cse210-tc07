# Street Shooter 
In the game of Street Shooter, the goal is to survive for as long as possible. Touch a box, and you lose a life! You automatically shoot throughout the game. Boxes display their health, and you must get it to 0 for the box to break! Red boxes increase lives, green boxes increase shooting speed, and blue boxes increase bullet damage. Use the left and right arrow keys to move. Good luck!
